                I can't really remember a time where I wasn't wanting to do two things: make games and tell stories. As a kid, I loved to read and to analyze books, I'd read just about any book I could get my hands, and play twice that number of games.<br /><br />
                I'm a firm believer that games are a still untapped well of artistic potential. With a good book, you're transported to a different world. With a movie, you get to see that world. Through a song, you can experience emotion in a universal language.
                <br />
                <br />

                But in games, you can be the one experincing them for yourself, you become the character, and it's that unique experience that I believe puts games at the top of artistic expression. It's something I'm eager to create for other people.

            Aside from games, I'm also a huge fan of animation, both domestic and foreign. It's another field I'm trying to get better at in my spare time.<br /> <br />
                I'm also in the process of writing my own novels and working on the world building for an RPG with my friends. <br />
                Some of my favorite games are Team Fortress Two, Titanfall Two, Fallout: New Vegas, The Beginner's Guide, the Guilty Gear series, The Binding of Issac, and Armored Core 6.
